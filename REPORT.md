## EXECUTION REPORT

### MONDAY

I started with the calender feature at the top, prior to this I had a layout developed
which divided the wholse screen into two parts (lower and upper). The upper part was to
hold the calender.

### TUESDAY

I developed the DesktopMail.js file with its accompanying style file, this is to enable the
app render the emails on desktop screens, I figured the mobile responsive mails would require
their own file. I also built the mail list header for this in the form of DesktopHeader.js.

### WEDNESDAY

I developed the MobileMail.js file with its accompanying style file, this is enable app to
render the emails on mobile screens. I figured I couldn't simply use css for this because the
structure of the mobile interface does not allow for a direct use of css media queries to
achieve desired results.

### THURSDAY

i developed the "zero results" page and made important tweaks on the app in various areas

### FRIDAY

I extended the user interface to include a capability for viewing emails in both dektop and
mobile screens, leveraging the context Api and react-router-dom. I also made optimizations
to improve responsiveness.
