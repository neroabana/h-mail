## SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

These are a couple of suggestions for improving the app

### Both desktop and mobile results headers could use decending sort functions

Decending sort functions could give an alternative view for the user and also
improve the user experience.

Given additional/relevant arrow graphics I could incorporate the improvements
in the app for better User Experience.

### App could use the ability to select all mails

right on the messages board

A functionality allowing for the selection of multiple mails in order to mark
them as spam or to delete them could be useful. This could take the form of
checkbox at the top of the messages list which when selected, causes all the mails
to be selected as well so global actions like mass deletions can be perfomed on them.

### An enterprise grade mail managment front end could leverage pagination

Somewhere in the bottom a provision to paginate could be useful
